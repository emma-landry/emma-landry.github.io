I am a third year PhD student in Biostatistics at UCLA, working with [Donatello Telesca](http://donatello-telesca.com/). My current research focuses on Bayesian methods in functional data analysis, particularly curve registration, with applications to neuroscience.

Prior to joining UCLA, I obtained my integrated masters in Mathematics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/). My thesis, supervised by [Seth Flaxman](https://sethrf.com/), analyzed the effects of Trump support and vaccine hesitancy on the SARS-CoV-2 time-varying reproduction number using a Bayesian semi-mechanistic model.

Outside research, I enjoy sports, in particular tennis, rock climbing, skiing, and now that I live in SoCal, surfing. Having grown up speaking French, Polish and English, I have also always been very interested in learning languages.
