I am a fifth year PhD candidate in Biostatistics at UCLA, working with [Donatello Telesca](http://donatello-telesca.com/). Prior to joining UCLA, I obtained my integrated masters in Mathematics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/), where I completed a thesis under the supervision of [Seth Flaxman](https://sethrf.com/).

My research focuses on Bayesian methods in functional data analysis, motivated by applications to neuroscience. My goal is to develop robust methodology for non-Euclidean data, in particular for density-valued observations.
